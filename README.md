# DSA

## Introduction
This repository contains comprehensive resources and implementations for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a learning guide and reference for fundamental and advanced DSA concepts.

## Arrays
Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements in contiguous memory locations. This section covers array manipulation, searching, sorting, and various array-based problems.

## Linked Lists
Linked Lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Topics include singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

## Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. This section covers binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and tree traversal algorithms.

## Graphs
Graphs consist of vertices and edges that connect them. Topics include graph representations, traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms, and minimum spanning trees.

## Stacks/Queues
Stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while Queues follow First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This section covers implementations and applications of both data structures.

## Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. Topics include base cases, recursive cases, and common recursive algorithms.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. This section covers memoization and tabulation approaches.

## Bit Manipulation
Bit Manipulation involves operations on individual bits of data. Topics include bitwise operators, bit masking, and efficient algorithms using bit manipulation.

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size. This section covers Big O notation and complexity analysis.

## Space Complexity
Space Complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of input size. Topics include auxiliary space and space optimization techniques.

## Practice Problems
This section contains curated practice problems covering all DSA topics, ranging from beginner to advanced levels.
